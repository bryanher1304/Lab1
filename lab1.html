          Something about myself is that I enjoy playing sports<br>
           especially Volleyall. I am a very caring person for my family.<br>
          I love to build things from ikea and legos which inspired me to<br>
          to be an architect.Just the idea of how its assemble and how they<br>
          designed it. I would also say that I love to trynew things like food.<br>
